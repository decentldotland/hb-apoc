With 0 downstream dependents, this specialized device provides a framework for validating that data has been properly received and acknowledged by authorized nodes in the network.\n\nThe module follows a two-flow design: an execution flow that validates incoming messages before allowing their execution, and an attestation flow that adds cryptographic attestations to outgoing messages. This dual approach ensures both the validity of incoming data and the verifiability of outgoing data, creating a chain of trust within the network.\n\nAt its core, the device implements a quorum-based consensus model where a configurable set of authority nodes must attest to a message's validity before it is accepted for processing. This creates a robust defense against malicious or corrupted data while maintaining the system's decentralized nature.\n\n## Key Characteristics\n\n- **Decentralized Consensus**: Implements a proof of authority consensus algorithm across multiple nodes\n- **Quorum-Based Validation**: Requires a configurable minimum number of attestations for message acceptance\n- **Cryptographic Attestations**: Uses digital signatures to verify message authenticity and authority approval\n- **Dual-Flow Design**: Separates execution validation from attestation generation\n- **Authority Configuration**: Allows flexible configuration of trusted authority nodes\n- **Parallel Attestation Collection**: Gathers attestations from multiple nodes concurrently\n- **Cross-Node Communication**: Coordinates with other nodes to collect attestations\n- **Error Handling**: Provides clear error responses for invalid or insufficiently attested messages\n- **User-Signed Message Bypass**: Allows user-signed messages to bypass the validation process\n- **Virtual File System Integration**: Stores attestations in the process's virtual file system\n\n## Dependencies\n\n### Library Dependencies\n- None explicitly imported beyond standard Erlang libraries\n\n### Upstream Dependencies\n- `ar_bundles`: For bundle manipulation, verification, and signing\n- `hb_util`: For ID encoding and decoding\n- `hb_router`: For finding compute nodes in the network\n- `hb_client`: For requesting attestations from other nodes\n- `hb_cache`: For reading messages from the cache\n- `hb`: For wallet access and node address information\n\n## Implementation Details\n\n### Initialization and Configuration\n\nThe module initializes with authority and quorum parameters:\n\n```erlang\ninit(S, Params) ->\n    {ok, S, extract_opts(Params)}.\n\nextract_opts(Params) ->\n    Authorities =\n        lists:filtermap(\n            fun({<<\"authority\">>, Addr}) -> {true, Addr};\n                (_) -> false end,\n                Params\n        ),\n    {_, RawQuorum} = lists:keyfind(<<\"quorum\">>, 1, Params),\n    Quorum = binary_to_integer(RawQuorum),\n    ?event({poda_authorities, Authorities}),\n    #{\n        authorities => Authorities,\n        quorum => Quorum\n    }.\n```\n\nThis function:\n1. Extracts authority addresses from initialization parameters\n2. Retrieves and converts the quorum value to an integer\n3. Returns a map with authorities and quorum settings\n\n### Execution Flow: Pre-Execution Validation\n\nThe core validation logic is implemented in the `execute/3` function:\n\n```erlang\nexecute(Outer = #tx { data = #{ <<\"body\">> := Msg } }, S = #{ <<\"pass\">> := 1 }, Opts) ->\n    case is_user_signed(Msg) of\n        true ->\n            {ok, S};\n        false ->\n            case validate(Msg, Opts) of\n                true ->\n                    % ... process valid message ...\n                {false, Reason} -> return_error(S, Reason)\n            end\n    end;\n```\n\nThis function:\n1. Checks if the message is user-signed (which bypasses validation)\n2. If not, validates the message against authority attestations\n3. For valid messages, extracts attestations and adds them to the virtual file system\n4. For invalid messages, returns an error\n\n### Multi-Stage Validation Process\n\nThe validation process follows a multi-stage approach:\n\n```erlang\nvalidate_stage(1, Msg, Opts) when is_record(Msg, tx) ->\n    validate_stage(1, Msg#tx.data, Opts);\nvalidate_stage(1, #{ <<\"attestations\">> := Attestations, <<\"body\">> := Content }, Opts) ->\n    validate_stage(2, Attestations, Content, Opts);\n    \n% ... subsequent stages ...\n\nvalidate_stage(3, Content, Attestations, Opts = #{ <<\"quorum\">> := Quorum }) ->\n    Validations =\n        lists:filter(\n            fun({_, Att}) -> validate_attestation(Content, Att, Opts) end,\n            maps:to_list(Attestations)\n        ),\n    case length(Validations) >= Quorum of\n        true -> true;\n        false -> {false, <<\"Not enough validations\">>}\n    end.\n```\n\nThis process:\n1. Stage 1: Extracts attestations and content from the message\n2. Stage 2: Verifies that all attestations are validly signed\n3. Stage 3: Validates attestations against the message and checks that the quorum is met\n\n### Attestation Validation\n\nIndividual attestations are validated through a comprehensive process:\n\n```erlang\nvalidate_attestation(Msg, Att, Opts) ->\n    MsgID = hb_util:encode(ar_bundles:id(Msg, unsigned)),\n    AttSigner = hb_util:encode(ar_bundles:signer(Att)),\n    ValidSigner = lists:member(AttSigner, maps:get(authorities, Opts)),\n    ValidSignature = ar_bundles:verify_item(Att),\n    RelevantMsg = ar_bundles:id(Att, unsigned) == MsgID orelse\n        (lists:keyfind(<<\"attestation-for\">>, 1, Att#tx.tags)\n            == {<<\"attestation-for\">>, MsgID}) orelse\n        ar_bundles:member(ar_bundles:id(Msg, unsigned), Att),\n    case ValidSigner and ValidSignature and RelevantMsg of\n        false -> false;\n        true -> true\n    end.\n```\n\nThis function checks:\n1. If the attestation signer is a recognized authority\n2. If the attestation has a valid signature\n3. If the attestation is relevant to the message being validated\n4. Only if all three conditions are met is the attestation considered valid\n\n### Attestation Flow: Adding Attestations to Results\n\nThe attestation flow begins with the `push/2` function and continues with supporting functions:\n\n```erlang\npush(_Item, S = #{ <<\"results\">> := ResultsMsg }) ->\n    NewRes = attest_to_results(ResultsMsg, S),\n    {ok, S#{ <<\"results\">> => NewRes }}.\n\nattest_to_results(Msg, S) ->\n    case is_map(Msg#tx.data) of\n        true ->\n            % Add attestations to the outbox and spawn items.\n            maps:map(\n                fun(Key, IndexMsg) ->\n                    case lists:member(Key, [<<\"/outbox\">>, <<\"/spawn\">>]) of\n                        true ->\n                            maps:map(\n                                fun(_, DeepMsg) -> add_attestations(DeepMsg, S) end,\n                                IndexMsg#tx.data\n                            );\n                        false -> IndexMsg\n                    end\n                end,\n                Msg#tx.data\n            );\n        false -> Msg\n    end.\n```\n\nThis function:\n1. Examines result messages and identifies outbox and spawn items\n2. Adds attestations to these items through the `add_attestations/2` function\n\n### Parallel Attestation Collection\n\nA key feature is the parallel collection of attestations from other nodes:\n\n```erlang\npfiltermap(Pred, List) ->\n    Parent = self(),\n    Pids = lists:map(fun(X) -> \n        spawn_monitor(fun() -> \n            Result = {X, Pred(X)},\n            Parent ! {self(), Result}\n        end)\n    end, List),\n    [\n        Res\n    ||\n        {true, Res} <-\n            lists:map(fun({Pid, Ref}) ->\n                receive\n                    {Pid, {_Item, Result}} -> Result;\n                    {'DOWN', Ref, process, Pid, _Reason} -> false;\n                    Other -> false\n                end\n            end, Pids)\n    ].\n```\n\nThis function:\n1. Spawns a separate process for each authority node\n2. Applies a predicate function (attestation request) in parallel\n3. Collects successful results and filters out failures\n4. Handles process crashes gracefully\n\n### Attestation Request and Bundling\n\nThe module implements a comprehensive process for collecting and bundling attestations:\n\n```erlang\n% ... in add_attestations function ...\nAttestations = pfiltermap(\n    fun(Address) ->\n        case hb_router:find(compute, ar_bundles:id(Process, unsigned), Address) of\n            {ok, ComputeNode} ->\n                Res = hb_client:compute(\n                    ComputeNode,\n                    ar_bundles:id(Process, signed),\n                    ar_bundles:id(Assignment, signed),\n                    #{ <<\"attest-to\">> => MsgID }\n                ),\n                case Res of\n                    {ok, Att} -> {true, Att};\n                    _ -> false\n                end;\n            _ -> false\n        end\n    end,\n    InitAuthorities -- [hb:address()]\n),\nLocalAttestation = ar_bundles:sign_item(\n    #tx{ tags = [{<<\"attestation-for\">>, MsgID}], data = <<>> },\n    Wallet\n),\n% ... bundle creation ...\n```\n\nThis code:\n1. Filters out the local node to avoid redundant attestation\n2. Finds compute nodes for each authority using the router\n3. Requests attestations from these nodes\n4. Creates a local attestation\n5. Bundles all attestations together with the message\n\n## Integration with HyperBEAM\n\n### Integration with Bundle System\n\nThe module deeply integrates with HyperBEAM's bundle system through:\n\n1. **Bundle Verification**: Uses `ar_bundles:verify_item/1` to verify attestation signatures\n   ```erlang\n   ValidSignature = ar_bundles:verify_item(Att)\n   ```\n\n2. **Bundle Signing**: Uses `ar_bundles:sign_item/2` to sign attestations\n   ```erlang\n   LocalAttestation = ar_bundles:sign_item(#tx{...}, Wallet)\n   ```\n\n3. **Bundle Normalization**: Uses `ar_bundles:normalize/1` to prepare bundles\n   ```erlang\n   ar_bundles:normalize(#tx{...})\n   ```\n\n### Integration with Router and Client Systems\n\nThe module coordinates with other nodes through the router and client systems:\n\n1. **Node Discovery**: Uses `hb_router:find/3` to locate compute nodes\n   ```erlang\n   hb_router:find(compute, ar_bundles:id(Process, unsigned), Address)\n   ```\n\n2. **Remote Computation**: Uses `hb_client:compute/4` to request attestations\n   ```erlang\n   hb_client:compute(ComputeNode, ..., #{ <<\"attest-to\">> => MsgID })\n   ```\n\n### Integration with Cache System\n\nThe module interacts with the cache system to find process information:\n\n1. **Message Reading**: Uses `hb_cache:read_message/2` to retrieve messages\n   ```erlang\n   {ok, Proc} = hb_cache:read_message(Store, hb_util:id(Item#tx.target))\n   ```\n\n## Testing Approach\n\nThe module does not include explicit test functions, suggesting that testing may be:\n1. Integrated into higher-level system tests\n2. Performed through manual testing in a multi-node setup\n3. Addressed in separate test files not shown in this module\n\nThe module does include debugging tools:\n```erlang\n-hb_debug(print).\n?event({poda_authorities, Authorities})\n?debug_wait(10000)\n```\n\nThese facilitate testing and debugging by providing detailed event logs and optional debugging delays.\n\n## Observations and Insights\n\n### Strengths\n\n1. **Decentralized Trust**: Implements a genuinely decentralized consensus mechanism without a single point of failure.\n\n2. **Configurable Security**: Allows configuration of authority lists and quorum sizes to adapt to different security needs.\n\n3. **Robust Validation**: Performs multi-stage validation checking authority membership, signature validity, and message relevance.\n\n4. **Parallel Processing**: Uses concurrent execution for attestation collection, improving efficiency in multi-node environments.\n\n5. **Graceful Error Handling**: Provides clear error responses and handles node failures gracefully.\n\n### Design Patterns\n\n1. **Multi-Stage Validation**: Uses a multi-stage pipeline for validating messages.\n\n2. **Parallel Execution**: Implements parallel processing for distributed operations.\n\n3. **Actor Model**: Follows the actor model with message passing between processes.\n\n4. **Filter-Map Pattern**: Uses the filter-map pattern to process collections of attestations.\n\n5. **Chain of Responsibility**: Implements a chain of validation checks that must all pass.\n\n### Challenges and Limitations\n\n1. **Complex State Management**: Manages complex state across multiple nodes and validation stages.\n\n2. **Network Dependency**: Heavily relies on network communication, which could be a bottleneck.\n\n3. **Partial Implementation**: Contains TODO comments and debug macros indicating incomplete aspects.\n\n4. **Error Resilience**: May face challenges with network partitions or authority node failures.\n\n5. **Scalability Concerns**: May face scalability issues with large authority sets due to the need to collect multiple attestations.\n\n### Future Opportunities\n\n1. **Improved Error Handling**: Enhancing error handling for network failures and timeouts.\n\n2. **Performance Optimization**: Optimizing the attestation collection process for larger networks.\n\n3. **Dynamic Authority Management**: Implementing dynamic authority set management.\n\n4. **Caching Attestations**: Adding caching mechanisms for frequently accessed attestations.\n\n5. **Advanced Consensus Models**: Extending the consensus model with more sophisticated algorithms.\n\n## Architectural Significance\n\nThe module has several points of architectural significance:\n\n1. **Consensus Layer**: Provides a decentralized consensus layer for the HyperBEAM system.\n\n2. **Trust Framework**: Establishes a framework for trust in a distributed environment.\n\n3. **Data Validation**: Ensures data validity and availability across the network.\n\n4. **Attestation Chain**: Creates chains of attestations that provide cryptographic proof of data validation.\n\n5. **Cross-Node Coordination**: Demonstrates patterns for coordinating operations across multiple nodes.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe `dev_poda.erl` module implements a sophisticated proof of authority consensus mechanism that ensures data availability and validity in HyperBEAM's distributed environment. By requiring attestations from a configurable set of authority nodes and enforcing a quorum-based validation model, it provides a robust framework for establishing trust in a decentralized system.\n\nThe module's dual-flow design separates the validation of incoming messages from the generation of attestations for outgoing messages, creating a comprehensive approach to data integrity. Its integration with HyperBEAM's bundle system, router, client, and cache components showcases how complex distributed systems can coordinate to achieve consensus without central control.\n\nWhile there are opportunities for enhancement in areas like error handling, performance optimization, and dynamic authority management, the current implementation provides a solid foundation for decentralized consensus. As HyperBEAM continues to evolve, this proof of data availability mechanism will likely play a crucial role in ensuring the integrity and reliability of distributed operations within the network.\n"},"Devices Ecosystem/30_dev_test_analysis.md":{"content":"# Testing Utility Device Analysis (`dev_test.erl`)\n\n## Overview\n\nThe `dev_test.erl` module serves as a comprehensive testing utility within HyperBEAM, designed to validate the functionality of the Converge system and demonstrate reference implementations of various device handlers.

However, some aspects that could be considered incomplete or candidates for future enhancement include:\n\n1. The `snapshot` handler implementation is minimal, returning only an empty map. This might be intentional for testing purposes, but a more robust implementation could provide better testing coverage.\n\n2. There is an implicit expectation that the `already-seen` list exists in several handlers, but the error handling for its absence is only implemented in the `restore` handler, not in the `compute` handler.\n\n3. The module is named \"Test-Device/1.0\", which suggests a versioning scheme, but there's no documentation about what might change in future versions or what backward compatibility guarantees exist.\n\n4. The `postprocess` handler mentions \"HTTP server\", but the integration is very limited, only setting a flag rather than demonstrating typical HTTP response patterns.\n\nThese points are not explicitly marked as TO-DO items but represent areas where the module could potentially be expanded or improved in the future.\n"},"Devices Ecosystem/31_dev_monitor_analysis.md":{"content":"# Process Monitoring Device Analysis (`dev_monitor.erl`)\n\n## Overview\n\nThe `dev_monitor.erl` module implements a lightweight monitoring framework within HyperBEAM, allowing dynamic observation of process execution without modifying the core process logic. With 0 downstream dependents, this utility device provides a flexible approach to runtime observation and implements a variant of the observer pattern.\n\nThis module serves as a non-invasive monitoring mechanism, enabling external functions to \"hook into\" the process execution lifecycle at key points. By maintaining a list of monitor functions that are called at specific execution phases, it facilitates runtime analysis, debugging, metrics collection, and other cross-cutting concerns without requiring changes to the monitored process's primary business logic.\n\nThe device's design emphasizes simplicity and separation of concerns. It focuses exclusively on the monitoring workflow, with strict boundaries that ensure monitors can observe but not modify process state. This creates a clean interface for runtime observation while preserving the integrity of the monitored process execution.\n\n## Key Characteristics\n\n- **Dynamic Observer Pattern**: Implements a variant of the observer pattern for process execution\n- **Non-invasive Monitoring**: Allows monitoring without modifying the monitored process's logic\n- **Read-only Observers**: Enforces that monitors can observe but not mutate state\n- **Lifecycle Hooks**: Provides hooks at key points in the process execution lifecycle\n- **Self-cleaning Monitors**: Allows monitors to signal completion and be automatically removed\n- **Flexible Registration**: Supports dynamic addition of monitors during execution\n- **Minimal Interface**: Maintains a focused, simple API with clear responsibilities\n- **Event Logging**: Tracks monitor lifecycle through event logging\n- **Cross-cutting Concern Separation**: Cleanly separates monitoring from business logic\n\n## Dependencies\n\n### Library Dependencies\n- None explicitly imported beyond standard Erlang libraries\n\n### Upstream Dependencies\n- None explicitly listed in the code, though it relies on the HyperBEAM framework infrastructure\n\n## Implementation Details\n\n### Initialization\n\nThe module initializes with a list of monitor functions:\n\n```erlang\ninit(State, _, InitState) ->\n    {ok, State#{ <<\"monitors\">> => InitState }}.\n```\n\nThis function:\n1. Takes the current state, an unused parameter, and the initial monitor list\n2. Updates the state by adding the monitors to a dedicated key\n3. Returns the updated state\n\n### Execution Monitoring\n\nThe execution monitoring logic is handled by the `execute/2` function:\n\n```erlang\nexecute(Message, State = #{ <<\"pass\">> := Pass, <<\"passes\">> := Passes }) when Pass == Passes ->\n    signal(State, {message, Message});\nexecute(_, S) -> {ok, S}.\n```\n\nThis function:\n1. Checks if the current pass is the final pass (when `Pass == Passes`)\n2. If it is the final pass, signals all monitors with the current message\n3. Otherwise, returns the state unchanged\n\nThis approach ensures monitoring happens only on the final pass, which is typically when a process has reached its stable state.\n\n### Adding Monitors\n\nMonitors can be added dynamically using the `add_monitor/2` function:\n\n```erlang\nadd_monitor(Mon, State = #{ <<\"monitors\">> := Monitors }) ->\n    {ok, State#{ <<\"monitors\">> => [Mon | Monitors] }}.\n```\n\nThis function:\n1. Takes a monitor function and the current state\n2. Prepends the new monitor to the list of existing monitors\n3. Returns the updated state\n\n### End of Schedule Notification\n\nThe module also provides notification at the end of a schedule:\n\n```erlang\nend_of_schedule(State) -> signal(State, end_of_schedule).\n```\n\nThis function simply signals all monitors that the schedule has ended.\n\n### Signal Dispatch\n\nThe core of the monitoring functionality is implemented in the `signal/2` function:\n\n```erlang\nsignal(State = #{ <<\"monitors\">> := StartingMonitors }, Signal) ->\n    RemainingMonitors =\n        lists:filter(\n            fun(Mon) ->\n                case Mon(State, Signal) of\n                    done -> false;\n                    _ -> true\n                end\n            end,\n            StartingMonitors\n        ),\n    ?event({remaining_monitors, length(RemainingMonitors)}),\n    {ok, State#{ <<\"monitors\">> := RemainingMonitors }}.\n```\n\nThis function:\n1. Takes the current state and a signal to send to monitors\n2. Calls each monitor function with the state and signal\n3. Filters out monitors that return `done`, keeping only active monitors\n4. Logs an event with the number of remaining monitors\n5. Updates the state with the filtered list of monitors\n6. Returns the updated state\n\n### Message Field Usage\n\nThe module specifies that it uses all message fields:\n\n```erlang\nuses() -> all.\n```\n\nThis indicates that the monitoring device needs access to all fields in the process state.\n\n## Integration with HyperBEAM\n\n### Observer Pattern Integration\n\nThe module implements an observer pattern within HyperBEAM's device framework:\n\n1. **Monitor Registration**: Allows registering monitoring functions\n   ```erlang\n   add_monitor(Mon, State)\n   ```\n\n2. **Lifecycle Notifications**: Notifies monitors at key points in execution\n   ```erlang\n   signal(State, {message, Message})\n   signal(State, end_of_schedule)\n   ```\n\n3. **Self-deregistration**: Allows monitors to remove themselves when done\n   ```erlang\n   case Mon(State, Signal) of\n       done -> false;\n       _ -> true\n   end\n   ```\n\n### Event System Integration\n\nThe module integrates with HyperBEAM's event system for logging:\n\n```erlang\n?event({remaining_monitors, length(RemainingMonitors)})\n```\n\nThis logs the number of remaining monitors after each signal dispatch.\n\n## Observations and Insights\n\n### Strengths\n\n1. **Clean Separation**: Provides a clean separation between monitoring concerns and process logic.\n\n2. **Minimal Overhead**: The design minimizes overhead by executing monitors only at specific points.\n\n3. **Dynamic Registration**: Supports dynamic addition of monitors during runtime.\n\n4. **Self-cleaning**: Allows monitors to signal completion and be automatically removed.\n\n5. **Non-invasive**: Enables monitoring without requiring changes to the monitored process.\n\n### Design Patterns\n\n1. **Observer Pattern**: Implements a variant of the observer pattern for process execution.\n\n2. **Functional Callbacks**: Uses function references as callbacks for monitoring.\n\n3. **Filter Pattern**: Uses filtering to remove completed monitors.\n\n4. **Hook System**: Provides hooks at key points in the process execution lifecycle.\n\n5. **Immutable State**: Works with HyperBEAM's immutable state pattern, returning new state rather than modifying existing state.\n\n### Challenges and Limitations\n\n1. **Limited Documentation**: The module has minimal documentation about monitor function requirements.\n\n2. **No Error Handling**: Lacks explicit error handling for monitor functions that might fail.\n\n3. **Final Pass Only**: Only executes on the final pass, which may miss important state transitions.\n\n4. **No Standard Monitors**: Doesn't provide any standard monitor implementations.\n\n5. **Limited Signals**: Only provides signals for final message and end of schedule.\n\n### Future Opportunities\n\n1. **Extended Signals**: Adding more signal points in the execution lifecycle.\n\n2. **Standard Monitors**: Providing a library of standard monitors for common use cases.\n\n3. **Error Handling**: Adding explicit error handling for monitor function execution.\n\n4. **Monitor Prioritization**: Implementing priority ordering for monitor execution.\n\n5. **Monitor Categorization**: Adding categories or tags for monitors to enable selective signaling.\n\n## Architectural Significance\n\nThe module has several points of architectural significance:\n\n1. **Cross-cutting Concern Handling**: Provides a clean solution for cross-cutting concerns like logging, debugging, and metrics.\n\n2. **Non-invasive Observation**: Enables observation without modification of the observed system.\n\n3. **Extensibility Model**: Demonstrates HyperBEAM's extensibility through simple, focused components.\n\n4. **Functional Composition**: Shows how functional composition can be used for extending behavior.\n\n5. **Observer Integration**: Integrates the observer pattern within HyperBEAM's message-based architecture.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe `dev_monitor.erl` module represents a lightweight but powerful monitoring framework within HyperBEAM. By implementing a variant of the observer pattern, it enables non-invasive monitoring of process execution without requiring modifications to the core process logic.\n\nThe module's clean separation of monitoring concerns from business logic exemplifies good architectural design, allowing cross-cutting concerns like debugging, logging, and metrics collection to be addressed without polluting the primary code paths. Its simple yet effective API provides just enough functionality to be useful without unnecessary complexity.\n\nWhile there are opportunities for enhancement in areas like documentation, error handling, and extending the signaling points, the current implementation provides a solid foundation for runtime observation. As HyperBEAM continues to evolve, this monitoring capability offers a flexible mechanism for understanding and analyzing process behavior during development and in production environments.\n\n## TO-DO Comments and Incomplete Aspects\n\nThis module does not contain any explicit TO-DO comments, which suggests it is relatively complete for its intended purpose. However, some aspects that could be considered incomplete or candidates for future enhancement include:\n\n1. The module lacks detailed documentation about the expected interface for monitor functions beyond the implicit contract that they should return 'done' when finished.\n\n2. There's no explicit error handling for monitor functions that might throw exceptions, which could potentially disrupt the monitoring chain.\n\n3. The module only provides signals on the final pass and at the end of a schedule, which may limit the granularity of monitoring for complex processes.\n\n4. The implementation doesn't include any example or standard monitor functions, which would help demonstrate proper usage patterns.\n\nThese are not explicitly marked as TO-DO items but represent areas where the module could potentially be expanded or improved in the future.\n"}}
