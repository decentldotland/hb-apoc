```

The network routing system implements a sophisticated three-layer architecture that handles message routing, relaying, and secure communication:

1. **Message Routing Layer**
   - Implements intelligent route selection
   - Provides load balancing strategies
   - Handles route configuration
   - Manages routing tables
   - Optimizes message flow

2. **Message Relay Layer**
   - Supports synchronous operations
   - Enables asynchronous processing
   - Handles message forwarding
   - Manages relay endpoints
   - Ensures delivery reliability

3. **Security & Identity Layer**
   - Manages node identities
   - Establishes trust relationships
   - Handles cryptographic operations
   - Controls access permissions
   - Ensures secure communication

### 2. Component Integration

    participant App as Application
    participant Router as Router Device
    participant Relay as Relay Device
    participant GZ as Green Zone
    
    App->>Router: Send Message
    Router->>Router: Select Route
    Router->>Relay: Forward Message
    Relay->>GZ: Verify Identity
    GZ->>Relay: Confirm Trust
    Relay->>Router: Process Message
    Router->>App: Return Result
```

The system demonstrates sophisticated component integration:

1. **Router-Relay Integration**
   - Coordinated message handling

   - Trust establishment
   - Secure communication
   - Access control
   - Key management

3. **System-Wide Integration**
   - Unified message flow
   - Consistent security
   - Shared configuration
   - Error handling
   - Resource management
