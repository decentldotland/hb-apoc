## System Purpose & Design Philosophy

The Network & HTTP system in HyperBEAM provides a comprehensive networking solution that addresses several key challenges in distributed systems:

### 1. Protocol Abstraction & Flexibility
The system implements a sophisticated protocol abstraction layer that enables:

- **Protocol Independence**: Applications can work with a high-level message-based API without concerning themselves with the underlying transport protocol. The system automatically handles protocol selection, negotiation, and fallback between HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, and HTTP/3.

- **Format Conversion**: Messages are automatically converted between different formats (httpsig, ans104) as needed, with proper handling of headers, bodies, and metadata. This allows applications to work with native Erlang terms while the system handles all necessary transformations.

- **Transport Optimization**: Each protocol implementation is optimized for its specific use case:
  * HTTP/1.1 through httpc for basic needs
  * HTTP/2 through gun for high performance
  * HTTP/3 through quicer for cutting-edge features

### 2. Connection Management & Reliability
The system provides robust connection handling through:

- **Connection Pooling**: The client maintains a pool of connections, reusing them when possible to reduce overhead. This includes:
  * Connection tracking
  * State management
  * Automatic reconnection
  * Resource cleanup

- **Supervision Strategy**: A dedicated supervisor (hb_http_client_sup) ensures:
  * Process monitoring
  * Crash recovery
  * Resource management
  * State preservation

- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error management including:
  * Connection failures
  * Protocol errors
  * State recovery
  * Resource cleanup

### 3. Integration & Extensibility
The system is designed for seamless integration:

- **External Systems**: Direct integration with:
  * Arweave network through GraphQL
  * Prometheus for metrics
  * Cowboy for HTTP serving
  * Custom protocols as needed

- **Internal Systems**: Deep integration with:
  * Message protocol system
  * Storage & caching system
  * Process management
  * Event system

## Core Components & Their Roles

## Integration Points & Data Flow

### 1. Request Flow
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant App
    participant Server
    participant HTTP
    participant Client
    participant Gateway

    App->>Server: HTTP Request
    Server->>HTTP: Convert to Message
    HTTP->>Client: Process Request
    Client->>Gateway: Handle if Arweave
    Gateway->>Client: Response
    Client->>HTTP: Format Response
    HTTP->>Server: Convert to HTTP
    Server->>App: HTTP Response
```

### 2. Protocol Selection
```mermaid

    A[Request] --> B{Protocol?}
    B -->|HTTP/3| C[quicer]
    B -->|HTTP/2| D[gun]
    B -->|HTTP/1.1| E[httpc]
    C --> F[Response]
    D --> F
    E --> F
```

### 3. Message Processing
```mermaid

    B --> C[Convert Format]
    C --> D[Process Message]
    D --> E[Convert Response]
    E --> F[HTTP Response]
```
