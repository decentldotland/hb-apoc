### System Boundaries

The system's boundaries are carefully defined to ensure proper separation of concerns while enabling efficient communication:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[External Systems] -->|HTTP/Protocol| B[Network Layer]
    B -->|Messages| C[Protocol Layer]
    C -->|Data| D[Storage Layer]
    
    C -->|Events| E[Process Management]
    E -->|Control| F[System Core]
    
    F -->|Configuration| G[Integration Layer]
    G -->|External Data| A
    
    H[Development Tools] -->|Debug| F
    H -->|Trace| C
    
    I[Testing Framework] -->|Validate| B
    I -->|Benchmark| D
```

This architecture enables:
- Clear separation between external and internal components
- Well-defined communication paths between layers
- Proper isolation of concerns
- Efficient resource management
- Comprehensive system observability

### Interface Definitions

The system defines two primary types of interfaces:

1. **External Interfaces**
   These interfaces handle all external communication:
   ```erlang
   % HTTP interface demonstrating the request lifecycle
   handle_request(Request) ->
       % 1. Parse and validate incoming request
       ParsedRequest = parse_request(Request),
       
       % 2. Process through system layers
       % This shows how requests flow through the system
       Response = process_request(ParsedRequest),
       
       % 3. Format response for external consumption
       format_response(Response).
   ```
   This pattern ensures:
   - Proper request validation
   - Consistent error handling
   - Clean protocol boundaries
   - Secure processing
   - Proper response formatting

2. **Internal Interfaces**
   These interfaces manage inter-layer communication:
   ```erlang
   % Layer communication showing state management
   process_message(Message, State) ->
       % 1. Handle protocol-specific aspects
       {ok, ProcessedMsg} = protocol:handle(Message),
       
       % 2. Manage storage operations
       {ok, StoredData} = storage:store(ProcessedMsg),
       
       % 3. Update process state
       process:notify(stored, StoredData).
   ```
   This approach provides:
   - Clean layer separation
   - State isolation
   - Clear data flow
   - Error boundaries
   - Transaction management

## Component Integration

The system's components work together through well-defined integration patterns:

### Core Message Flow

The sequence diagram shows how messages flow through the system:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Network
    participant Protocol
    participant Storage
    participant Process
    
    Client->>Network: HTTP Request
    Network->>Protocol: Parse Message
    Protocol->>Storage: Store Data
    Storage-->>Protocol: Confirmation
    Protocol->>Process: Notify
    Process-->>Network: Response
    Network-->>Client: HTTP Response
```

This flow demonstrates:
- Clean request handling
- Proper data transformation
- State management
- Response coordination
- Error propagation
### Cross-Cutting Concerns

1. **Security Management**
   ```erlang
   % Security handling
   secure_operation(Operation, Context) ->
       % 1. Authentication
       {ok, Auth} = authenticate(Context),
       
       % 2. Authorization
       {ok, Perms} = authorize(Auth, Operation),
       
       % 3. Execution
       {ok, Result} = execute(Operation, Perms).
   ```

2. **Error Handling**
   ```erlang
   % Error propagation
   handle_error(Error, Context) ->
       % 1. Log error
       log_error(Error),
       
       % 2. Notify monitoring
       notify_monitoring(Error),
       
       % 3. Handle recovery
       handle_recovery(Error, Context).
   ```

### System-Wide Patterns

1. **Message Processing**
   ```erlang
   % Standard message flow
   process_flow() ->
       receive
           {message, Msg} ->
               % 1. Protocol handling
               {ok, Processed} = protocol:handle(Msg),
               
               % 2. Business logic
               {ok, Result} = logic:process(Processed),
               
               % 3. Response
               respond(Result)
       end.
   ```

2. **State Management**
   ```erlang
   % State handling pattern
   manage_state(Operation, State) ->
       % 1. Validate operation
       {ok, ValidOp} = validate(Operation),
       
       % 2. Apply operation
       {ok, NewState} = apply_operation(ValidOp, State),
       
       % 3. Persist changes
       persist_state(NewState).
   ```

# Patterns & Capabilities

## System-Wide Patterns

The HyperBEAM system employs several fundamental patterns that ensure consistency, reliability, and maintainability across all components.

### 1. Message Processing Pattern
This core pattern defines how messages flow through the system:

```erlang
% The message processing pattern demonstrates the standard flow for handling
% all types of messages in the system. This pattern ensures consistent
% processing, proper error handling, and reliable state management.
process_message(Message, Context) ->
    % Phase 1: Message Validation
    % Ensures message integrity and proper format
    {ok, ValidMsg} = validate_message(Message),
    
    % Phase 2: Protocol Processing
    % Handles protocol-specific transformations
    {ok, ProcessedMsg} = process_protocol(ValidMsg),
    
    % Phase 3: Business Logic
    % Applies domain-specific operations
    {ok, Result} = apply_business_logic(ProcessedMsg, Context),
    
    % Phase 4: Response Formation
    % Creates appropriate response format
    format_response(Result).
```

This pattern provides:
- **Consistent Processing**: Every message follows the same basic flow
- **Clear Boundaries**: Each phase has distinct responsibilities
- **Error Isolation**: Problems are caught and handled at appropriate levels
- **State Management**: Context is properly maintained and transformed
- **Protocol Independence**: Core logic is separated from protocol details

### 2. State Management Pattern
A sophisticated approach to handling system state:

```erlang
% The state management pattern shows how the system handles state changes
% across different components. It ensures consistency, durability, and proper
% event propagation.
manage_state_change(Operation, State, Context) ->
    % Phase 1: State Validation
    % Ensures the operation is valid for current state
    {ok, ValidOp} = validate_state_operation(Operation, State),
    
    % Phase 2: State Transformation
    % Applies the operation to create new state
    {ok, NewState} = apply_state_change(ValidOp, State),
    
    % Phase 3: Persistence
    % Ensures state changes are durable
    {ok, StoredState} = persist_state(NewState),
    
    % Phase 4: Event Propagation
    % Notifies interested parties of state change
    notify_state_change(StoredState, Context).
```

Key aspects:
- **Atomic Operations**: State changes are all-or-nothing
- **Consistency Checks**: Validates state transitions
- **Durability Guarantees**: Ensures state persistence
- **Event Notification**: Keeps system components synchronized
- **Context Awareness**: Maintains operation context

### 3. Resource Management Pattern
Careful handling of system resources:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Resource Request] -->|Validate| B[Resource Check]
    B -->|Allocate| C[Resource Pool]
    C -->|Monitor| D[Usage Tracking]
    D -->|Release| E[Cleanup]
    
    subgraph "Resource Lifecycle"
        B --> F[Validation]
        F --> G[Allocation]
        G --> H[Monitoring]
        H --> I[Recovery]
    end
```

This pattern ensures:
- **Resource Tracking**: All resources are monitored
- **Proper Cleanup**: Resources are always released
- **Usage Optimization**: Efficient resource utilization
- **Error Recovery**: Handles resource failures gracefully
- **Scalability**: Manages resource pools effectively

#  Design 

## Design Philosophy

The HyperBEAM system is built on several core design principles that guide its architecture and implementation:

### 1. Message-Centric Architecture
The system treats messages as first-class citizens:

```erlang
% The message-centric approach demonstrates how all system operations
% are expressed through message passing, ensuring clean interfaces and
% strong isolation between components.
handle_operation(Operation) ->
    % Phase 1: Message Creation
    % Transform operation into a message format that can flow through the system
    Message = create_message(Operation),
    
    % Phase 2: Message Processing
    % Route and handle the message through appropriate channels
    {ok, ProcessedMsg} = process_message(Message),
    
    % Phase 3: State Update
    % Apply message effects to system state
    {ok, NewState} = apply_message(ProcessedMsg),
    
    % Phase 4: Response
    % Generate appropriate response message
    create_response(NewState).
```

This philosophy ensures:
- **Clean Interfaces**: All interactions are message-based
- **Strong Isolation**: Components communicate only through messages
- **Easy Testing**: Messages can be intercepted and verified
- **Clear Boundaries**: System boundaries are well-defined
- **Audit Capability**: Message flows can be traced and analyzed

### 2. Layered Responsibility
The system is organized in clear layers with distinct responsibilities:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[External Interface Layer] -->|Messages| B[Protocol Layer]
    B -->|Transformed Data| C[Business Logic Layer]
    C -->|State Changes| D[Storage Layer]
    
    subgraph "Layer Responsibilities"
        E[Interface] -->|"Handles external communication"| F[Protocol]
        F -->|"Manages data formats"| G[Logic]
        G -->|"Implements business rules"| H[Storage]
    end
```

Benefits:
- **Clear Separation**: Each layer has distinct responsibilities
- **Easy Maintenance**: Changes are localized to specific layers
- **Simple Testing**: Layers can be tested in isolation
- **Clean Architecture**: Dependencies flow in one direction
- **Flexible Evolution**: Layers can evolve independently

### 3. State Management Philosophy
A comprehensive approach to system state:

```erlang
% The state management philosophy shows how the system thinks about
% and handles state changes, ensuring consistency and reliability
% across all operations.
manage_system_state(Operation, Context) ->
    % Phase 1: State Access
    % Retrieve current state with proper isolation
    {ok, CurrentState} = get_isolated_state(Context),
    
    % Phase 2: State Validation
    % Ensure operation is valid for current state
    {ok, ValidatedOp} = validate_operation(Operation, CurrentState),
    
    % Phase 3: State Transition
    % Apply operation with proper tracking
    {ok, NewState} = apply_state_transition(ValidatedOp, CurrentState),
    
    % Phase 4: State Persistence
    % Ensure state changes are durable
    persist_state_change(NewState, Context).
```

Key principles:
- **State Isolation**: State changes are contained and controlled
- **Explicit Transitions**: State changes are clearly defined
- **Change Tracking**: State modifications are tracked
- **Recovery Support**: State can be recovered and rebuilt
- **Consistency Rules**: State changes follow clear rules

### 4. Error Handling Strategy
A sophisticated approach to system reliability:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Error Detection] -->|Analyze| B[Error Classification]
    B -->|Route| C[Error Handler]
    C -->|Execute| D[Recovery Action]
    
    subgraph "Error Management"
        E[Local Recovery] -->|"Handle locally"| F[Success]
        E -->|"Escalate"| G[Supervisor]
        G -->|"Restart"| H[New Instance]
    end
```

This ensures:
- **Early Detection**: Problems are caught early
- **Clean Recovery**: Errors are handled gracefully
- **State Protection**: System state is preserved
- **Clear Patterns**: Error handling is consistent
- **Proper Escalation**: Problems are routed appropriately

## System Evolution

### 1. Extension Points
The system provides several key extension mechanisms:

```erlang
% Extension mechanism showing how the system can be extended
% without modifying core components
extend_system(Extension) ->
    % Phase 1: Validation
    % Ensure extension meets system requirements
    {ok, ValidExt} = validate_extension(Extension),
    
    % Phase 2: Integration
    % Connect extension to system
    {ok, Connected} = integrate_extension(ValidExt),
    
    % Phase 3: Activation
    % Enable extension functionality
    activate_extension(Connected).
```
