# Process Management System Observations

## Architectural Patterns

### 1. Process Monitoring
The system implements comprehensive process monitoring through:
- Process lifecycle tracking (hb_process_monitor)
- Event logging and tracing (hb_event)
- Metrics collection (hb_metrics_collector)
- Logging management (hb_logger)

### 2. Component Separation
Clear separation of concerns across components:
- Process monitoring and supervision
- Event logging and tracing
- Metrics collection and reporting
- Debug and error handling
