# Codec and Data Format Subsystem Overview

## Introduction

The Codec and Data Format Subsystem serves as the translation layer between HyperBEAM's internal representations and external data formats. This subsystem is critical for maintaining data integrity, type information, cryptographic properties, and hierarchical relationships across format boundaries, enabling seamless interoperability between the HyperBEAM ecosystem and various external systems.

The subsystem implements a collection of codecs that follow a consistent interface pattern, allowing HyperBEAM's messaging infrastructure to dynamically select and apply appropriate encoding and decoding operations based on content types and application requirements. Each codec specializes in bridging HyperBEAM's Type-Annotated Binary Message (TABM) format with a specific external format, ranging from web standards like HTTP and JSON to blockchain formats like Arweave's ANS-104.

## Architectural Overview

### Component Organization

The Codec and Data Format Subsystem is organized into three primary component types:

1. **Core Format Implementations** - Define HyperBEAM's native formats and serialization mechanisms
   - `dev_codec_structured.erl` - Implements the Type-Annotated Binary Message (TABM) format
   - `dev_codec_flat.erl` - Provides flattening/unflattening of nested message structures

2. **Standard Protocol Adapters** - Bridge to widely used internet and web standards
   - `hb_structured_fields.erl` - Implements HTTP Structured Fields (RFC-9651)
   - `dev_codec_httpsig.erl` - Handles HTTP Message Signatures (RFC-9421)
   - `dev_codec_httpsig_conv.erl` - Converts between TABM and HTTP message structures
   - `dev_codec_json.erl` - Provides JSON serialization and deserialization

3. **Blockchain Integration Codecs** - Connect to distributed ledger technologies
   - `dev_codec_ans104.erl` - Bridges to Arweave blockchain via the ANS-104 format

### Key Relationships

The modules in this subsystem have carefully designed relationships that promote code reuse and separation of concerns:

1. **Hierarchical Dependence**:
   - `dev_codec_httpsig_conv.erl` depends on `dev_codec_httpsig.erl` for attestation functions
   - `dev_codec_json.erl` delegates to `dev_codec_httpsig.erl` for security operations
   - `dev_codec_httpsig.erl` uses `hb_structured_fields.erl` for header parsing and formatting

2. **Interface Consistency**:
   - All codecs implement a common interface with `to/1` and `from/1` functions
   - Most implement additional attestation-related functions like `attest/3` and `verify/3`
   - Many provide utilities like `content_type/1` for MIME type handling
   - Some include specialized serialization/deserialization functions

3. **Format Specialization**:
   - Each codec specializes in exactly one external format
   - Some formats require multiple modules due to complexity (e.g., HTTP uses several)
   - Simpler formats have more lightweight implementations (e.g., JSON)

## Core Design Patterns

### Bidirectional Conversion

Every codec implements bidirectional conversion between HyperBEAM's internal representation and an external format:

```erlang
% Convert from external format to TABM
from(ExternalFormat) -> TABM.

% Convert from TABM to external format
to(TABM) -> ExternalFormat.
```

This pattern allows messages to seamlessly cross system boundaries while maintaining their semantic integrity.

### Attestation Delegation

Several codecs delegate cryptographic operations to specialized modules:

```erlang
% In dev_codec_json.erl
attest(Msg, Req, Opts) -> dev_codec_httpsig:attest(Msg, Req, Opts).
verify(Msg, Req, Opts) -> dev_codec_httpsig:verify(Msg, Req, Opts).
```

This pattern:
- Avoids duplication of complex cryptographic code
- Ensures consistent security behavior across formats
- Centralizes security-critical operations for easier auditing

### Type and Structure Preservation

Codecs carefully preserve Erlang types and nested structures during conversion:

```erlang
% In hb_structured_fields.erl
to_bare_item(integer, Value) -> {integer, Value};
to_bare_item(decimal, Value) -> {decimal, Value};
to_bare_item(string, Value) -> {string, Value};
to_bare_item(token, Value) -> {token, Value};
to_bare_item(byte_sequence, Value) -> {binary, Value};
to_bare_item(boolean, Value) -> {boolean, Value}.
```

This precision ensures that data doesn't lose fidelity during format transitions.

### Recursive Processing

Many codecs handle nested structures through recursive processing:

```erlang
% In dev_codec_flat.erl - recursive structure flattening
to(Map) when is_map(Map) ->
    maps:fold(
        fun(Key, Value, Acc) ->
            case to(Value) of
                SubMap when is_map(SubMap) ->
                    maps:fold(
                        fun(SubKey, SubValue, InnerAcc) ->
                            maps:put(
                                hb_path:to_binary([Key, SubKey]),
                                SubValue,
                                InnerAcc
                            )
                        end,
                        Acc,
                        SubMap
                    );
                SimpleValue ->
                    maps:put(hb_path:to_binary([Key]), SimpleValue, Acc)
            end
        end,
        #{},
        Map
    ).
```

This approach enables handling of arbitrarily complex data structures.

### Binary Passthrough

All codecs implement binary passthrough for already-encoded data:

```erlang
% In dev_codec_structured.erl
from(Binary) when is_binary(Binary) -> Binary;
```

This pattern avoids unnecessary re-encoding and allows partial processing pipelines.

## Security Considerations

### Cryptographic Attestations

The subsystem places high emphasis on cryptographic attestation handling:

1. **Signature Preservation** - Signatures are carefully preserved across format boundaries
2. **Verification Flow** - Clear separation between signature generation and verification
3. **Format-Specific Considerations** - Accommodations for format-specific signature requirements
4. **Attestation Metadata** - Rich metadata maintained with signatures
5. **Chain of Trust** - Support for verification chains and hashpaths

### Type Safety

Strong type safety is enforced throughout:

1. **Type Validation** - Input validation before processing
2. **Type Annotation** - Explicit type information during serialization
3. **Type Recovery** - Accurate type restoration during deserialization
4. **Error Handling** - Clear error reporting for type mismatches

### Data Integrity

Several mechanisms ensure data integrity:

1. **Collision Detection** - Identification of path or name collisions
2. **Original Value Preservation** - Maintenance of original formatting where cryptographically relevant
3. **Content Digests** - Support for content verification through digest comparison
4. **Structure Verification** - Validation of structural integrity during transformations

## Integration with Other Subsystems

## Conclusion

The Codec and Data Format Subsystem demonstrates a thoughtful approach to the complex problem of format translation while preserving rich semantics, types, and security properties. Its modular design with consistent interfaces enables HyperBEAM to interact with diverse external systems while maintaining its internal data model integrity.

The subsystem's attention to cryptographic details, hierarchical structure preservation, and format-specific requirements shows a mature understanding of the challenges in bridging between different data representation systems. By providing a collection of specialized codecs with a common interface pattern, it achieves flexibility without sacrificing consistency or security.

As HyperBEAM continues to evolve, this subsystem provides a solid foundation for expanding interoperability with additional formats and systems, while maintaining the cryptographic guarantees and rich type information that characterize the platform's approach to data representation and exchange.
