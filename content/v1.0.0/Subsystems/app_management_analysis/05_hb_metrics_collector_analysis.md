# `hb_metrics_collector.erl` Analysis

## Overview

`hb_metrics_collector.erl` implements a Prometheus metrics collector for the HyperBEAM system, providing critical operational visibility into system performance and health. This module serves as a foundational component of the Application Management Subsystem's observability infrastructure, enabling real-time monitoring and alerting capabilities based on system metrics.

The module follows the Prometheus collector pattern, implementing the `prometheus_collector` behavior to expose system-level metrics to the Prometheus monitoring system. Though minimal in its current implementation, it provides essential metrics about process uptime and system load, establishing a framework that can be extended to include additional metrics as needed.

This metrics collection approach represents a modern observability pattern, separating metric generation from collection and visualization, which allows HyperBEAM to leverage the extensive Prometheus ecosystem for monitoring, alerting, and dashboard visualization through tools like Grafana.

## Key Characteristics

- **Minimal Implementation**: Focuses on essential metrics with clear documentation
- **Cross-Subsystem Visibility**: Provides visibility into core system properties

## Dependencies

### Library Dependencies
- `prometheus_collector`: For the collector behavior specification
- `prometheus_model_helpers`: For metric creation and formatting
- `cpu_sup`: For system load statistics

### Upstream Dependencies
None identified in the module. This appears to be a standalone module that others may depend upon.

## Implementation Details

### Metric Collection

The module implements the `collect_mf` callback to define and collect metrics:

```erlang
collect_mf(_Registry, Callback) ->
    {Uptime, _} = erlang:statistics(wall_clock),
    Callback(
        create_gauge(
            process_uptime_seconds,
            "The number of seconds the Erlang process has been up.",
            Uptime
        )
    ),

    SystemLoad = cpu_sup:avg5(),

    Callback(
        create_gauge(
            system_load,
            "The load values are proportional to how long"
            " time a runnable Unix process has to spend in the run queue"
            " before it is scheduled. Accordingly, higher values mean"
            " more system load",
            SystemLoad
        )
    ),

    ok.
```

This implementation:
1. Collects the Erlang process uptime using `erlang:statistics(wall_clock)`
2. Creates and registers a gauge metric for the process uptime
3. Collects the 5-minute system load average using `cpu_sup:avg5()`
4. Creates and registers a gauge metric for the system load
5. Returns `ok` to indicate successful metric collection

### Metric Formatting

The module implements the `collect_metrics` callback to format the collected metrics:

```erlang
collect_metrics(system_load, SystemLoad) ->
    prometheus_model_helpers:gauge_metrics(
        [
            {[], SystemLoad}
        ]
    );
collect_metrics(process_uptime_seconds, Uptime) ->
    UptimeSeconds = Uptime / 1000,
    prometheus_model_helpers:gauge_metrics(
        [
            {[], UptimeSeconds}
        ]
    ).
```

This implementation:
1. Provides specialized formatting for each metric type
2. Converts uptime from milliseconds to seconds for human readability
3. Creates gauge metrics with no labels (empty list `[]`)
4. Uses Prometheus helper functions for consistent formatting

### Metric Creation Helper

The module implements a private helper function for creating gauge metrics:

```erlang
create_gauge(Name, Help, Data) ->
    prometheus_model_helpers:create_mf(Name, Help, gauge, ?MODULE, Data).
```

This implementation:
1. Encapsulates the metric creation process
2. Provides a consistent structure for all gauge metrics
3. Includes the metric name, help text, type, collector module, and data
4. Leverages Prometheus helper functions for standardized creation

## Questions and Insights

### Questions

1. **Metric Selection**: Why were these specific metrics chosen, and what additional metrics might be valuable for monitoring HyperBEAM?

2. **Collection Frequency**: How often are these metrics collected? The Prometheus collector API doesn't specify collection frequency directly.

3. **Metric Persistence**: Are these metrics persisted anywhere, or are they only available for real-time querying through Prometheus?

4. **Dimensional Data**: Why aren't labels used for more dimensional analysis? Many Prometheus deployments benefit from dimensional metrics.

5. **Integration Points**: How is this collector registered with Prometheus, and what components query these metrics?

### Insights

1. **Observability Foundation**: The module establishes a foundation for system observability using industry-standard tools and patterns.

2. **Minimal Approach**: The implementation starts with essential system metrics rather than attempting to be comprehensive immediately.

3. **Performance Awareness**: The choice of metrics reflects a focus on system performance monitoring, particularly resource utilization.

4. **Standardized Formatting**: The consistent use of Prometheus helpers ensures compatibility with the wider Prometheus ecosystem.

5. **Extension Readiness**: The modular structure makes it straightforward to add new metrics as monitoring needs evolve.

## Recategorization Considerations

This module is appropriately categorized within the Application Management Subsystem. It provides essential operational monitoring capabilities that directly support application management functions.

Some factors that support this categorization:

1. **Operational Focus**: The module is primarily concerned with operational visibility and monitoring.

2. **System-Wide Scope**: It monitors system-level metrics rather than domain-specific functionality.

3. **Management Support**: It provides data to support management decisions about resource allocation and system health.

4. **Infrastructure Role**: It serves as infrastructure for monitoring rather than implementing business logic.

## Additional Observations
