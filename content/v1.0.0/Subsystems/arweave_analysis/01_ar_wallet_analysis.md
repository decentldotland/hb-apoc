## Implementation Details

### Key Generation

The module provides functions for generating new cryptographic key pairs:

```erlang
new() ->
    new({rsa, 65537}).
new(KeyType = {KeyAlg, PublicExpnt}) when KeyType =:= {rsa, 65537} ->
    {[_, Pub], [_, Pub, Priv|_]} = {[_, Pub], [_, Pub, Priv|_]}
        = crypto:generate_key(KeyAlg, {4096, PublicExpnt}),
    {{KeyType, Priv, Pub}, {KeyType, Pub}}.
```

This implementation:
1. Defaults to RSA with a public exponent of 65537 (a common secure choice)
2. Generates 4096-bit RSA keys for strong security
3. Returns both the private and public key components in a structured tuple

### Signature Generation and Verification

The module implements signature generation and verification for RSA:

```erlang
sign({{rsa, PublicExpnt}, Priv, Pub}, Data, DigestType) when PublicExpnt =:= 65537 ->
    rsa_pss:sign(
        Data,
        DigestType,
        #'RSAPrivateKey'{
            publicExponent = PublicExpnt,
            modulus = binary:decode_unsigned(Pub),
            privateExponent = binary:decode_unsigned(Priv)
        }
    ).

verify({{rsa, PublicExpnt}, Pub}, Data, Sig, DigestType) when PublicExpnt =:= 65537 ->
    rsa_pss:verify(
        Data,
        DigestType,
        Sig,
        #'RSAPublicKey'{
            publicExponent = PublicExpnt,
            modulus = binary:decode_unsigned(Pub)
        }
    ).
```

These functions:
1. Convert between HyperBEAM's key representation and the format expected by `rsa_pss`
2. Support different digest types, defaulting to SHA-256
3. Handle the necessary type conversions for the cryptographic operations

### Address Generation

The module provides address derivation from public keys:

```erlang
to_address(PubKey) ->
    to_address(PubKey, ?DEFAULT_KEY_TYPE).
to_address(PubKey, {rsa, 65537}) when bit_size(PubKey) == 256 ->
    %% Small keys are not secure, nobody is using them, the clause
    %% is for backwards-compatibility.
    PubKey;
to_address({{_, _, PubKey}, {_, PubKey}}, {rsa, 65537}) ->
    to_address(PubKey);
to_address(PubKey, {rsa, 65537}) ->
    to_rsa_address(PubKey).
```

The implementation:
1. Provides backward compatibility for small keys (256 bits)
2. Handles nested key structures automatically
3. Uses SHA-256 hashing for address generation via the `to_rsa_address/1` function

### Wallet File Management

The module includes comprehensive wallet file handling:

```erlang
new_keyfile(KeyType, WalletName) when is_list(WalletName) ->
    new_keyfile(KeyType, list_to_binary(WalletName));
new_keyfile(KeyType, WalletName) ->
    {Pub, Priv, Key} =
        case KeyType of
            {?RSA_SIGN_ALG, PublicExpnt} ->
                % RSA key generation with JWK encoding
                ...
            {?ECDSA_SIGN_ALG, secp256k1} ->
                % ECDSA key generation with JWK encoding
                ...
            {?EDDSA_SIGN_ALG, ed25519} ->
                % EdDSA key generation with JWK encoding
                ...
        end,
    Filename = wallet_filepath(WalletName, Pub, KeyType),
    filelib:ensure_dir(Filename),
    file:write_file(Filename, Key),
    {{KeyType, Priv, Pub}, {KeyType, Pub}}.

load_keyfile(File) ->
    {ok, Body} = file:read_file(File),
    {Key} = jiffy:decode(Body),
    {Pub, Priv, KeyType} =
        case lists:keyfind(<<"kty">>, 1, Key) of
            {<<"kty">>, <<"EC">>} ->
                % ECDSA key loading
                ...
            {<<"kty">>, <<"OKP">>} ->
                % EdDSA key loading
                ...
            _ ->
                % RSA key loading
                ...
        end,
    {{KeyType, Priv, Pub}, {KeyType, Pub}}.
```

This implementation:
1. Supports multiple key types with appropriate JSON Web Key (JWK) formatting
2. Persists keys to the filesystem with appropriate naming
3. Loads keys from files with format detection based on JWK structure
4. Ensures compatibility between stored and runtime key formats

### HMAC Generation

The module provides HMAC functionality:

```erlang
hmac(Data) ->
    hmac(Data, sha256).

hmac(Data, DigestType) -> crypto:mac(hmac, DigestType, <<"ar">>, Data).
```

This simple implementation:
1. Uses "ar" as the HMAC key, providing a domain-specific HMAC
2. Supports configurable digest types, defaulting to SHA-256
3. Leverages the Erlang crypto library's mac functionality

## Questions and Insights

### Questions

1. **Algorithm Extensibility**: How easily can new cryptographic algorithms be added to the wallet system? The current implementation has specific handlers for RSA, ECDSA, and EdDSA.

2. **Key Migration**: Is there a pathway for migrating between key types? The code doesn't show explicit support for this operation.

3. **Key Rotation Practices**: What are the recommended practices for key rotation in a system using this wallet module?

4. **Secure Key Storage**: How are wallet files protected at rest? The implementation doesn't show encryption of the wallet files themselves.

5. **Hardware Wallet Integration**: Is there potential for extending this system to work with hardware wallets or secure enclaves?

### Insights

## Recategorization Considerations

This module is correctly categorized within the Arweave Integration Subsystem, as it specifically handles Arweave-compatible wallet operations. Despite its broad usage across the system, its primary purpose is to provide the cryptographic foundation for Arweave blockchain integration.

Some aspects to consider:

1. **Cryptographic Core**: While the module could conceptually fit within a general cryptographic utilities category, its specific focus on Arweave wallet formats makes the current categorization more appropriate.

2. **Dependency Pattern**: The high number of downstream dependents (24) underscores its foundational role within the Arweave integration ecosystem.

3. **Algorithmic Specificity**: The module's implementation choices (like RSA defaults and Arweave-specific address generation) are tailored to Arweave compatibility.

## Additional Observations

### Security Considerations

- The default RSA key size is 4096 bits, providing strong security
- The module includes specific handling for the RSA-PSS signature scheme
