# Testing Utility Device Analysis (`dev_test.erl`)

## Overview

The `dev_test.erl` module serves as a comprehensive testing utility within HyperBEAM, designed to validate the functionality of the Converge system and demonstrate reference implementations of various device handlers. With 0 downstream dependents, this specialized module focuses on providing examples and testing facilities rather than production functionality.

The module offers a collection of reference implementations for all major device handler types (info, compute, init, restore, snapshot, postprocess), showcasing proper implementation patterns and enabling verification of the Converge resolution mechanism. It also includes examples of custom functions that might be called from other contexts like WebAssembly execution.

Named specifically as "Test-Device/1.0" to avoid conflicts with other testing functionality, this module plays a crucial role in the development and maintenance of HyperBEAM by providing a stable, well-understood reference point for testing device behaviors and message resolution.

## Dependencies

### Library Dependencies
- EUNIT library for testing

### Upstream Dependencies
- `hb_converge`: For message resolution and field access/modification
- `hb_private`: For setting private state information
- `hb_http_server`: For setting server options in the postprocess handler
- `dev_message`: As the default handler in the info function

## Implementation Details

### Info Function

The module provides an `info/1` function that returns a map with the default handler:

```erlang
info(_) ->
    #{
        <<"default">> => dev_message
    }.
```

This demonstrates the pattern for delegating default behavior to another device (in this case, `dev_message`).

### Test Function

A simple test function is provided for verifying the resolution mechanism:

```erlang
test_func(_) ->
    {ok, <<"GOOD_FUNCTION">>}.
```

This function is used in the tests to confirm that the Converge system can correctly resolve and call functions exported by a device.

### Compute Handler

The module includes an example compute handler that tracks which slots have been processed:

```erlang
compute(Msg1, Msg2, Opts) ->
    AssignmentSlot = hb_converge:get(<<"slot">>, Msg2, Opts),
    Seen = hb_converge:get(<<"already-seen">>, Msg1, Opts),
    ?event({compute_called, {msg1, Msg1}, {msg2, Msg2}, {opts, Opts}}),
    {ok,
        hb_converge:set(
            Msg1,
            #{
                <<"random-key">> => <<"random-value">>,
                <<"results">> =>
                    #{ <<"assignment-slot">> => AssignmentSlot },
                <<"already-seen">> => [AssignmentSlot | Seen]
            },
            Opts
        )
    }.
```

This handler:
1. Retrieves the current slot number from the input message
2. Gets the list of previously seen slots from the state
3. Logs the call details
4. Returns an updated state with:
   - A random key-value pair
   - The current slot in the results
   - An updated list of seen slots

### Init Handler

The module provides an example initialization handler:

```erlang
init(Msg, _Msg2, Opts) ->
    ?event({init_called_on_dev_test, Msg}),
    {ok, hb_converge:set(Msg, #{ <<"already-seen">> => [] }, Opts)}.
```

This handler:
1. Logs the initialization call
2. Initializes the "already-seen" list to an empty list

### Restore Handler

An example restore handler is included to demonstrate state restoration:

```erlang
restore(Msg, _Msg2, Opts) ->
    ?event({restore_called_on_dev_test, Msg}),
    case hb_converge:get(<<"already-seen">>, Msg, Opts) of
        not_found ->
            ?event({restore_not_found, Msg}),
            {error, <<"No viable state to restore.">>};
        AlreadySeen ->
            ?event({restore_found, AlreadySeen}),
            {ok,
                hb_private:set(
                    Msg,
                    #{ <<"test-key/started-state">> => AlreadySeen },
                    Opts
                )
            }
    end.
```

This handler:
1. Logs the restore call
2. Checks if the "already-seen" key exists in the state
3. If not found, returns an error
4. If found, saves the value to a private key and returns success

### WASM-Compatible Function

The module includes a function that could be imported into a WebAssembly environment:

```erlang
mul(Msg1, Msg2) ->
    ?event(mul_called),
    State = hb_converge:get(<<"state">>, Msg1, #{ hashpath => ignore }),
    [Arg1, Arg2] = hb_converge:get(<<"args">>, Msg2, #{ hashpath => ignore }),
    ?event({mul_called, {state, State}, {args, [Arg1, Arg2]}}),
    {ok, #{ <<"state">> => State, <<"results">> => [Arg1 * Arg2] }}.
```

This function:
1. Logs the function call
2. Retrieves the current state
3. Extracts two arguments from the input message
4. Logs the state and arguments
5. Returns the state and the product of the two arguments

### Snapshot Handler

A minimal snapshot handler is provided:

```erlang
snapshot(_Msg1, _Msg2, _Opts) ->
    {ok, #{}}.
```

This handler simply returns an empty map, demonstrating the minimal implementation required.

### Postprocess Handler

An example postprocess handler for HTTP server integration:

```erlang
postprocess(_Msg, #{ <<"body">> := Msgs }, Opts) ->
    ?event({postprocess_called, Opts}),
    hb_http_server:set_opts(Opts#{ <<"postprocessor-called">> => true }),
    {ok, Msgs}.
```

This handler:
1. Logs the postprocess call
2. Sets a flag in the HTTP server options to indicate that the postprocessor was called
3. Returns the body messages unchanged

## Integration with HyperBEAM

### Integration with Converge System

The module is primarily designed to test and demonstrate the Converge system:

1. **Function Resolution**: Tests the ability to resolve and call functions
   ```erlang
   hb_converge:resolve(Msg, test_func, #{})
   ```

2. **Message Manipulation**: Demonstrates proper message field access and modification
   ```erlang
   hb_converge:get(<<"slot">>, Msg2, Opts)
   hb_converge:set(Msg1, #{ ... }, Opts)
   ```

3. **Handler Pattern**: Implements the standard handler pattern expected by the device framework
   ```erlang
   {ok, UpdatedMessage}
   ```

### Integration with HTTP Server

The module includes integration with the HTTP server system:

1. **Option Setting**: Sets options in the HTTP server
   ```erlang
   hb_http_server:set_opts(Opts#{ <<"postprocessor-called">> => true })
   ```

2. **Postprocessing**: Demonstrates the postprocessing pattern for HTTP responses

### Integration with WASM System

The module shows integration with WebAssembly execution:

1. **Importable Function**: Provides a function suitable for import into a WASM environment
   ```erlang
   mul(Msg1, Msg2) -> ...
   ```

2. **State Handling**: Demonstrates state and argument handling pattern for WASM integration

## Testing Approach

The module includes three EUNIT test functions:

### Function Resolution Test

```erlang
device_with_function_key_module_test() ->
    Msg =
        #{
            <<"device">> => <<"Test-Device@1.0">>
        },
    ?assertEqual(
        {ok, <<"GOOD_FUNCTION">>},
        hb_converge:resolve(Msg, test_func, #{})
    ).
```

This test verifies that:
1. The Converge system can correctly resolve devices by name
2. Functions exported by the device are callable through the resolution mechanism

### Compute Handler Test

```erlang
compute_test() ->
    Msg0 = #{ <<"device">> => <<"Test-Device@1.0">> },
    {ok, Msg1} = hb_converge:resolve(Msg0, init, #{}),
    Msg2 =
        hb_converge:set(
            #{ <<"path">> => <<"compute">> },
            #{
                <<"slot">> => 1,
                <<"body/number">> => 1337
            },
            #{}
        ),
    {ok, Msg3} = hb_converge:resolve(Msg1, Msg2, #{}),
    ?assertEqual(1, hb_converge:get(<<"results/assignment-slot">>, Msg3, #{})),
    % ... more test steps ...
```

This test:
1. Creates a device message
2. Initializes the device
3. Creates a compute message with a slot
4. Resolves the compute message
5. Verifies that the results contain the correct slot
6. Repeats the process with a different slot
7. Confirms that both slots are tracked in the "already-seen" list

### Restore Handler Test

```erlang
restore_test() ->
    Msg1 = #{ <<"device">> => <<"Test-Device@1.0">>, <<"already-seen">> => [1] },
    {ok, Msg3} = hb_converge:resolve(Msg1, <<"restore">>, #{}),
    ?assertEqual([1], hb_private:get(<<"test-key/started-state">>, Msg3, #{})).
```

This test:
1. Creates a device message with an "already-seen" list
2. Calls the restore handler
3. Verifies that the private state was set correctly

## Conclusion

The `dev_test.erl` module serves as a valuable testing utility and reference implementation within HyperBEAM. While it's not intended for production use, it plays a crucial role in validating the core functionality of the Converge system and providing examples of proper device behavior implementation.

The module's comprehensive coverage of handler types, clear implementation patterns, and integration with testing frameworks make it an essential component for maintaining the quality and stability of the HyperBEAM system. Its design as a self-testing reference implementation provides developers with concrete examples to follow when implementing their own devices.

As HyperBEAM continues to evolve, this testing utility will likely remain an important tool for ensuring that core functionality remains intact and that developers have a clear understanding of proper implementation patterns.

## TO-DO Comments and Incomplete Aspects

This module does not contain any explicit TO-DO comments, which suggests it is relatively complete and stable in its current form. However, some aspects that could be considered incomplete or candidates for future enhancement include:

1. The `snapshot` handler implementation is minimal, returning only an empty map. This might be intentional for testing purposes, but a more robust implementation could provide better testing coverage.

2. There is an implicit expectation that the `already-seen` list exists in several handlers, but the error handling for its absence is only implemented in the `restore` handler, not in the `compute` handler.

3. The module is named "Test-Device/1.0", which suggests a versioning scheme, but there's no documentation about what might change in future versions or what backward compatibility guarantees exist.

4. The `postprocess` handler mentions "HTTP server", but the integration is very limited, only setting a flag rather than demonstrating typical HTTP response patterns.

These points are not explicitly marked as TO-DO items but represent areas where the module could potentially be expanded or improved in the future.
