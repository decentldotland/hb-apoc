# Path Lookup Device Analysis (`dev_lookup.erl`)

## Overview

The `dev_lookup.erl` module implements a content retrieval mechanism within HyperBEAM, providing a streamlined way to access cached data by ID with content negotiation capabilities. With 0 downstream dependents, this utility module bridges the gap between HyperBEAM's content-addressed storage and client applications by supporting content format conversion based on the requested media type.

The module's primary function is to retrieve content from the cache using a specified ID and then optionally transform that content based on the client's indicated preferred format (via the "accept" field). This pattern follows the HTTP content negotiation model, where clients can request specific representations of a resource.

Of particular note is the module's support for the "application/aos-2" format, providing compatibility with Arweave Open Standard 2 (AOS-2) format, which enhances interoperability with AO (Arweave Computation) applications. This capability enables seamless integration between HyperBEAM's native message format and external systems using JSON-based formats.

## Key Characteristics

- **ID-Based Retrieval**: Locates content in the cache based on a specified ID
- **Content Negotiation**: Supports returning content in different formats based on the "accept" field
- **Format Conversion**: Automatically converts between HyperBEAM's native format and AOS-2 JSON format
- **Error Handling**: Provides clear error responses for not-found scenarios
- **Cache Integration**: Directly leverages HyperBEAM's cache subsystem for content storage and retrieval
- **HTTP Compatibility**: Works within HyperBEAM's HTTP interface as shown in tests
- **Binary and Structured Data Support**: Handles both binary content and structured message data

## Implementation Details

### Read Function

The module implements a single function, `read/3`, which forms the core of its functionality:

```erlang
read(_M1, M2, Opts) ->
    ID = hb_converge:get(<<"target">>, M2, Opts),
    ?event({lookup, {id, ID}, {opts, Opts}}),
    case hb_cache:read(ID, Opts) of
        {ok, Res} ->
            ?event({lookup_result, Res}),
            case hb_converge:get(<<"accept">>, M2, Opts) of
                <<"application/aos-2">> ->
                    Struct = dev_json_iface:message_to_json_struct(Res),
                    {ok,
                        #{
                            <<"body">> => jiffy:encode(Struct),
                            <<"content-type">> => <<"application/aos-2">>
                        }};
                _ ->
                    {ok, Res}
            end;
        not_found ->
            ?event({lookup_not_found, ID}),
            {error, not_found}
    end.
```

This function:
1. Extracts the target ID from the input message
2. Logs the lookup attempt
3. Attempts to read the content from the cache
4. If successful:
   - Checks the requested format (via the "accept" field)
   - If AOS-2 is requested, converts the message to a JSON structure and encodes it
   - Otherwise, returns the raw content
5. If the content is not found, returns an error

### Format Conversion Logic

The format conversion logic for AOS-2 is implemented as follows:

```erlang
case hb_converge:get(<<"accept">>, M2, Opts) of
    <<"application/aos-2">> ->
        Struct = dev_json_iface:message_to_json_struct(Res),
        {ok,
            #{
                <<"body">> => jiffy:encode(Struct),
                <<"content-type">> => <<"application/aos-2">>
            }};
    _ ->
        {ok, Res}
end
```

This section:
1. Checks if the requested format is "application/aos-2"
2. If so, converts the message to a JSON structure using `dev_json_iface:message_to_json_struct/1`
3. Encodes the structure as JSON using `jiffy:encode/1`
4. Returns the encoded JSON with appropriate content-type metadata
5. If any other format is requested, returns the raw content

## Integration with HyperBEAM

### Integration with Cache System

The module integrates with HyperBEAM's cache system through:

1. **Content Retrieval**: Uses `hb_cache:read/2` to retrieve content by ID
   ```erlang
   case hb_cache:read(ID, Opts) of
      {ok, Res} -> ...
   ```

2. **Error Handling**: Handles cache miss scenarios appropriately
   ```erlang
   not_found ->
       ?event({lookup_not_found, ID}),
       {error, not_found}
   ```

### Integration with Message System

The module integrates with HyperBEAM's message system through:

1. **Field Access**: Uses `hb_converge:get/3` to access fields in the message
   ```erlang
   ID = hb_converge:get(<<"target">>, M2, Opts)
   ```

2. **Format Specification**: Uses the "accept" field to determine the desired response format
   ```erlang
   case hb_converge:get(<<"accept">>, M2, Opts) of
   ```

### Integration with JSON Interface

The module integrates with HyperBEAM's JSON interface through:

1. **Format Conversion**: Uses `dev_json_iface:message_to_json_struct/1` to convert messages to JSON structures
   ```erlang
   Struct = dev_json_iface:message_to_json_struct(Res)
   ```

2. **Content-Type Metadata**: Includes appropriate content-type information in the response
   ```erlang
   <<"content-type">> => <<"application/aos-2">>
   ```

## Testing Approach

The module includes four test functions that cover different aspects of its functionality:

### Binary Content Test

```erlang
binary_lookup_test() ->
    Bin = <<"Simple unsigned data item">>,
    {ok, ID} = hb_cache:write(Bin, #{}),
    {ok, RetrievedBin} = read(#{}, #{ <<"target">> => ID }, #{}),
    ?assertEqual(Bin, RetrievedBin).
```

This test:
1. Writes a simple binary to the cache
2. Retrieves it using the lookup device
3. Verifies that the retrieved content matches the original

### Message Content Test

```erlang
message_lookup_test() ->
    Msg = #{ <<"test-key">> => <<"test-value">>, <<"data">> => <<"test-data">> },
    {ok, ID} = hb_cache:write(Msg, #{}),
    {ok, RetrievedMsg} = read(#{}, #{ <<"target">> => ID }, #{}),
    ?assertEqual(Msg, RetrievedMsg).
```

This test:
1. Writes a structured message to the cache
2. Retrieves it using the lookup device
3. Verifies that the retrieved message matches the original

### AOS-2 Format Test

```erlang
aos2_message_lookup_test() ->
    Msg = #{ <<"test-key">> => <<"test-value">>, <<"data">> => <<"test-data">> },
    {ok, ID} = hb_cache:write(Msg, #{}),
    {ok, RetrievedMsg} =
        read(
            #{},
            #{ <<"target">> => ID, <<"accept">> => <<"application/aos-2">> },
            #{}
        ),
    Decoded = jiffy:decode(hb_converge:get(<<"body">>, RetrievedMsg, #{}), [return_maps]),
    ?assertEqual(<<"test-data">>, hb_converge:get(<<"data">>, Decoded, #{})).
```

This test:
1. Writes a structured message to the cache
2. Retrieves it using the lookup device with "application/aos-2" as the accept type
3. Decodes the resulting JSON body
4. Verifies that a specific field in the decoded content matches the original

### HTTP Integration Test

```erlang
http_lookup_test() ->
    Store = #{
        <<"store-module">> => hb_store_fs,
        <<"prefix">> => <<"cache-mainnet">>
    },
    Opts = #{ store => [Store] },
    Msg = #{ <<"test-key">> => <<"test-value">>, <<"data">> => <<"test-data">> },
    {ok, ID} = hb_cache:write(Msg, Opts),
    Node = hb_http_server:start_node(Opts),
    Wallet = hb:wallet(),
    Req = hb_message:attest(#{
        <<"path">> => <<"/~lookup@1.0/read?target=", ID/binary>>,
        <<"device">> => <<"lookup@1.0">>,
        <<"accept">> => <<"application/aos-2">>
    }, Wallet),
    {ok, Res} = hb_http:post(Node, Req, Opts),
    Decoded = jiffy:decode(hb_converge:get(<<"body">>, Res, Opts), [return_maps]),
    ?assertEqual(<<"test-data">>, hb_converge:get(<<"data">>, Decoded, Opts)).
```

This test:
1. Sets up a file system store and configuration
2. Writes a structured message to the cache
3. Starts an HTTP server node
4. Constructs an authenticated request to the lookup device via HTTP
5. Sends the request and receives a response
6. Decodes the JSON body from the response
7. Verifies that a specific field in the decoded content matches the original
