# `dev_scheduler.erl` Analysis

## Overview

`dev_scheduler.erl` implements a scheduler device for the HyperBEAM system, serving as the core component for process and message management. This module is responsible for orchestrating the execution order of messages within processes, maintaining a consistent execution history, and coordinating between local and remote schedulers in a distributed environment.

The scheduler operates on a slot-based model, where each message is assigned to a specific numeric slot for execution. This deterministic ordering ensures that all nodes processing the same messages will arrive at the same state, which is crucial for maintaining consistency in a distributed system.

As noted in the module's documentation, the scheduler device accepts and responds to various HTTP-like requests, exposing endpoints for retrieving information, checking slots, managing schedules, and scheduling new messages.

## Key Characteristics

- **Slot-Based Scheduling**: Assigns messages to specific numbered slots for deterministic execution
- **Process Management**: Tracks and manages processes and their associated message schedules
- **Local and Remote Operation**: Supports both local execution and redirection to remote schedulers
- **Format Adaptation**: Handles multiple protocol variants and format representations
- **Service Registration**: Provides registry mechanisms for scheduler locations
- **HTTP Integration**: Designed to work seamlessly within an HTTP-based interface
- **Checkpoint Support**: Enables state persistence and recovery
- **Format Flexibility**: Supports multiple response formats including application/http and application/aos-2

## Implementation Details

### Default Handler and Routing

The module follows a device pattern with a default handler that routes requests based on their method and path:

```erlang
info() -> 
    #{
        exports =>
            [
                register,
                status,
                next,
                schedule,
                slot,
                init,
                checkpoint
            ],
        excludes => [set, keys],
        default => fun router/4
    }.

router(_, Msg1, Msg2, Opts) ->
    ?event({scheduler_router_called, {msg2, Msg2}, {opts, Opts}}),
    schedule(Msg1, Msg2, Opts).
```

The `router/4` function handles incoming requests and dispatches them to appropriate handlers. For schedule-related operations, it further routes to specific handlers based on the HTTP method:

```erlang
schedule(Msg1, Msg2, Opts) ->
    ?event({resolving_schedule_request, {msg2, Msg2}, {state_msg, Msg1}}),
    case hb_converge:get(<<"method">>, Msg2, <<"GET">>, Opts) of
        <<"POST">> -> post_schedule(Msg1, Msg2, Opts);
        <<"GET">> -> get_schedule(Msg1, Msg2, Opts)
    end.
```

### Process and Schedule Management

The scheduler handles the registration and management of processes:

```erlang
register(_Msg1, Req, Opts) ->
    % Ensure that the request is signed by the operator.
    ?event({registering_scheduler, {msg1, _Msg1}, {req, Req}, {opts, Opts}}),
    {ok, OnlyAttested} = hb_message:with_only_attested(Req),
    % ... validation logic ...
    
    % Construct the new scheduler location message.
    NewSchedulerLocation = #{
        <<"data-protocol">> => <<"ao">>,
        <<"variant">> => <<"ao.N.1">>,
        <<"type">> => <<"scheduler-location">>,
        <<"url">> => URL,
        <<"nonce">> => NewNonce,
        <<"time-to-live">> => TimeToLive,
        <<"codec-device">> => Codec
    },
    Signed = hb_message:attest(NewSchedulerLocation, Opts, Codec),
    % ... upload logic ...
    {ok, Signed}
```

The scheduler supports finding the appropriate server for a given process, either locally or remotely:

```erlang
find_server(ProcID, Msg1, ToSched, Opts) ->
    case get_hint(ProcID, Opts) of
        {ok, Hint} ->
            ?event({found_hint_in_proc_id, Hint}),
            generate_redirect(ProcID, Hint, Opts);
        not_found ->
            ?event({no_hint_in_proc_id, ProcID}),
            case dev_scheduler_registry:find(ProcID, false, Opts) of
                PID when is_pid(PID) ->
                    ?event({found_pid_in_local_registry, PID}),
                    {local, PID};
                not_found ->
                    % ... complex logic to find process and determine scheduler ...
            end
    end.
```

### Slot Management

The module provides a function to determine the current slot for a process:

```erlang
slot(M1, M2, Opts) ->
    ?event({getting_current_slot, {msg, M1}}),
    ProcID = find_target_id(M1, M2, Opts),
    case find_server(ProcID, M1, Opts) of
        {local, PID} ->
            ?event({getting_current_slot, {proc_id, ProcID}}),
            {Timestamp, Hash, Height} = ar_timestamp:get(),
            #{ current := CurrentSlot, wallet := Wallet } =
                dev_scheduler_server:info(PID),
            {ok, #{
                <<"process">> => ProcID,
                <<"current">> => CurrentSlot,
                <<"timestamp">> => Timestamp,
                <<"block-height">> => Height,
                <<"block-hash">> => Hash,
                <<"cache-control">> => <<"no-store">>,
                <<"wallet-address">> => hb_util:human_id(ar_wallet:to_address(Wallet))
            }};
        {redirect, Redirect} ->
            % ... remote slot handling ...
    end.
```

For remote slots, the module handles protocol variants:

```erlang
remote_slot(<<"ao.N.1">>, ProcID, Node, Opts) ->
    % The process is running on a mainnet AO-Core scheduler, so we can just
    % use the `/slot' endpoint to get the current slot.
    ?event({getting_slot_from_ao_core_remote,
        {path, {string, <<"/", ProcID/binary, "/slot">>}}}),
    hb_http:get(Node, <<ProcID/binary, "/slot">>, Opts);

remote_slot(<<"ao.TN.1">>, ProcID, Node, Opts) ->
    % The process is running on a testnet AO-Core scheduler, so we need to use
    % `/processes/procID/latest` to get the current slot.
    Path = << ProcID/binary, "/latest?proc-id=", ProcID/binary>>,
    % ... complex handling for testnet format ...
```

### Next Message Determination

The scheduler determines the next message to process for a given process:

```erlang
next(Msg1, Msg2, Opts) ->
    ?event(next, {scheduler_next_called, {msg1, Msg1}, {msg2, Msg2}}),
    Schedule =
        hb_private:get(
            <<"priv/scheduler/assignments">>,
            Msg1,
            Opts
        ),
    LastProcessed = hb_util:int(hb_converge:get(<<"at-slot">>, Msg1, Opts)),
    % ... schedule handling logic ...
    
    case (LastProcessed + 1) == Slot of
        true ->
            NextMessage =
                hb_converge:get(
                    Slot,
                    FilteredAssignments,
                    Opts
                ),
            NextState =
                hb_private:set(
                    Msg1,
                    <<"schedule/assignments">>,
                    hb_converge:remove(FilteredAssignments, Slot),
                    Opts
                ),
            ?event(next,
                {next_returning, {slot, Slot}, {message, NextMessage}}),
            {ok, #{ <<"body">> => NextMessage, <<"state">> => NextState }};
        false ->
            {error,
                #{
                    <<"status">> => 503,
                    <<"body">> => <<"No assignment found for next slot.">>
                }
            }
    end.
```

### Remote Integration

The module handles routing to remote schedulers when necessary:

```erlang
generate_redirect(ProcID, SchedulerLocation, Opts) ->
    Variant = hb_converge:get(<<"variant">>, SchedulerLocation, <<"ao.N.1">>, Opts),
    ?event({generating_redirect, {proc_id, ProcID}, {variant, Variant}}),
    RedirectLocation =
        case is_binary(SchedulerLocation) of
            true -> SchedulerLocation;
            false ->
                hb_converge:get_first(
                    [
                        {SchedulerLocation, <<"url">>},
                        {SchedulerLocation, <<"location">>}
                    ],
                    <<"/">>,
                    Opts
                )
        end,
    {redirect,
        #{
            <<"status">> => 307,
            <<"location">> => RedirectLocation,
            <<"body">> =>
                <<"Redirecting to scheduler: ", RedirectLocation/binary>>,
            <<"variant">> => Variant
        }
    }.
```

For remote schedule operations, it handles different protocol variants:

```erlang
post_remote_schedule(RawProcID, Redirect, OnlyAttested, Opts) ->
    RemoteOpts = Opts#{ http_client => httpc },
    ProcID = without_hint(RawProcID),
    Location = hb_converge:get(<<"location">>, Redirect, Opts),
    Parsed = uri_string:parse(Location),
    Node = uri_string:recompose((maps:remove(query, Parsed))#{path => <<"/">>}),
    Variant = hb_converge:get(<<"variant">>, Redirect, <<"ao.N.1">>, Opts),
    case Variant of
        <<"ao.N.1">> ->
            PostMsg = #{
                <<"path">> => << ProcID/binary, "/schedule">>,
                <<"body">> => OnlyAttested,
                <<"method">> => <<"POST">>
            },
            hb_http:post(Node, PostMsg, RemoteOpts);
        <<"ao.TN.1">> ->
            post_legacy_schedule(ProcID, OnlyAttested, Node, RemoteOpts)
    end.
```

The module also handles legacy format adaptations:

```erlang
post_legacy_schedule(ProcID, OnlyAttested, Node, Opts) ->
    ?event({encoding_for_legacy_scheduler, {node, {string, Node}}}),
    Encoded =
        try
            Item =
                hb_message:convert(
                    OnlyAttested,
                    <<"ans104@1.0">>,
                    Opts
                ),
            ?event(ans104, {encoded_for_legacy_scheduler, {item, Item}, {exact, {explicit, Item}}}),
            {ok, ar_bundles:serialize(Item)}
        catch
            _:_ ->
                {error,
                    #{
                        <<"status">> => 422,
                        <<"body">> =>
                            <<
                                "Failed to post schedule on ", Node/binary,
                                " for ", ProcID/binary, ". Try different encoding?"
                            >>
                    }
                }
        end,
    % ... further handling and HTTP posting ...
```
