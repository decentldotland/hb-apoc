# Computation Unit Tracking Device Analysis (`dev_cu.erl`)

## Overview

The `dev_cu.erl` module implements a computation unit tracking device within HyperBEAM, serving as an interface for executing and managing distributed computations. With 0 downstream dependents, this specialized device handles the orchestration of computation assignments, result retrieval, and attestation generation.

The module bridges between computation assignments and their execution, enabling distributed computing across the HyperBEAM network. It provides mechanisms for pushing computation tasks to other nodes and retrieving their results, as well as supporting cryptographic attestation of specific computation outputs. This creates a framework for verifiable distributed computing with clear provenance of results.

While concise in implementation, the module plays a critical role in HyperBEAM's distributed computation capabilities, enabling tasks to be offloaded to remote nodes while maintaining cryptographic verification of the results. It represents an important building block in creating distributed computation workflows with verifiable outputs.

- `hb_opts`: For accessing store configuration
- `hb`: For accessing wallet information
- `hb_util`: For ID handling and decoding

## Implementation Details

### Computation Pushing

The module implements a mechanism for pushing computations to be executed:

```erlang
push(Msg, S = #{ assignment := Assignment, logger := _Logger }) ->
    ?event(
        {pushing_message,
            {assignment, hb_util:id(Assignment, unsigned)},
            {message, hb_util:id(Msg, unsigned)}
        }
    ),
    case hb_client:compute(Assignment, Msg) of
        {ok, Results} ->
            ?event(computed_results),
            {ok, S#{ results => Results }};
        Error ->
            throw({cu_error, Error})
    end.
```

This function:
1. Takes a message and a state map containing an assignment and logger
2. Logs the pushing of a message with assignment and message IDs
3. Calls `hb_client:compute/2` to execute the computation remotely
4. Updates the state with the computation results or throws an error if computation fails

### Computation Execution

The module provides a mechanism for executing computations and handling their results:

```erlang
execute(CarrierMsg, S) ->
    MaybeBundle = ar_bundles:hd(CarrierMsg),
    Store = hb_opts:get(store),
    Wallet = hb:wallet(),
    {ok, Results} =
        case MaybeBundle of
            #tx{data = #{ <<"body">> := _Msg, <<"assignment">> := Assignment }} ->
                % TODO: Execute without needing to call the SU unnecessarily.
                {_, ProcID} = lists:keyfind(<<"process">>, 1, Assignment#tx.tags),
                ?event({dev_cu_computing_from_full_assignment, {process, ProcID}, {slot, hb_util:id(Assignment, signed)}}),
                hb_process:result(ProcID, hb_util:id(Assignment, signed), Store, Wallet);
            _ ->
                case lists:keyfind(<<"process">>, 1, CarrierMsg#tx.tags) of
                    {_, Process} ->
                        {_, Slot} = lists:keyfind(<<"slot">>, 1, CarrierMsg#tx.tags),
                        ?event({dev_cu_computing_from_slot_ref, {process, Process}, {slot, Slot}}),
                        hb_process:result(Process, Slot, Store, Wallet);
                    false ->
                        {error, no_viable_computation}
                end
        end,
    % Additional attestation handling...
```

This function:
1. Extracts a potential bundle from the carrier message
2. Retrieves the store configuration and wallet information
3. Uses two different strategies to get computation results:
   - From a full assignment included in the bundle
   - From process and slot references in the carrier message tags
4. Logs detailed events about the computation source
5. Calls `hb_process:result/4` to retrieve the computation results

### Attestation Handling

The module supports generating attestations for specific computation results:

```erlang
{ResType, ModState = #{ results := _ModResults }} =
    case lists:keyfind(<<"attest-to">>, 1, CarrierMsg#tx.tags) of
        {_, RawAttestTo} ->
            AttestTo = hb_util:decode(RawAttestTo),
            ?event({attest_to_only_message, RawAttestTo}),
            case ar_bundles:find(AttestTo, Results) of
                not_found ->
                    ?event(message_to_attest_to_not_found),
                    {ok,
                        S#{
                            results =>
                                #tx {
                                    tags = [{<<"status">>, 404}],
                                    data = <<"Requested message to attest to not in results bundle.">>
                                }
                        }
                    };
                _ ->
                    ?event(message_to_attest_to_found),
                    {ok, S#{
                        results => ar_bundles:sign_item(
                            #tx {
                                tags = [
                                    {<<"status">>, 200},
                                    {<<"attestation-for">>, RawAttestTo}
                                ],
                                data = <<>>
                            },
                            hb:wallet()
                        )
                    }}
            end;
        false ->
            {ok, S#{ results => Results }}
    end,
```

This section:
1. Checks for an `attest-to` tag in the carrier message
2. If present, attempts to find the specified message in the results bundle
3. If found, signs a new item with a reference to the attested message
4. If not found, returns a 404 status message
5. If no attestation is requested, simply returns the computation results

## Integration with HyperBEAM

### Integration with Client System

The module integrates with HyperBEAM's client system through:

1. **Remote Computation**: Uses `hb_client:compute/2` to delegate computation to remote nodes
   ```erlang
   hb_client:compute(Assignment, Msg)
   ```

2. **State Management**: Maintains computation state and results

### Integration with Process System

The module integrates with HyperBEAM's process system through:

1. **Result Retrieval**: Uses `hb_process:result/4` to retrieve computation results
   ```erlang
   hb_process:result(ProcID, hb_util:id(Assignment, signed), Store, Wallet)
   ```

2. **Process Identification**: Extracts process IDs from assignments and message tags

### Integration with Bundle System

The module integrates with HyperBEAM's bundle system through:

1. **Bundle Extraction**: Uses `ar_bundles:hd/1` to extract the first item from a bundle
   ```erlang
   MaybeBundle = ar_bundles:hd(CarrierMsg)
   ```

2. **Item Finding**: Uses `ar_bundles:find/2` to locate specific items in a bundle
   ```erlang
   ar_bundles:find(AttestTo, Results)
   ```

3. **Item Signing**: Uses `ar_bundles:sign_item/2` to sign attestations
   ```erlang
   ar_bundles:sign_item(#tx{...}, hb:wallet())
   ```

## Testing Approach

The module includes EUNIT integration for testing:

```erlang
-include_lib("eunit/include/eunit.hrl").
```

However, no explicit test functions are defined within the module, suggesting that testing for this module may be:
1. Integrated into higher-level system tests
2. Defined in separate test files
3. Performed through manual testing and debugging

The module does include debug logging with the directive:
```erlang
-hb_debug(print).
```

This enables detailed event logging during execution, which would assist in debugging and testing.

## Conclusion

The `dev_cu.erl` module provides essential functionality for tracking and verifying distributed computations within HyperBEAM. Though concise in implementation, it bridges critical gaps between computation assignment, execution, and verification, enabling complex distributed computing workflows.

The module's ability to push computations to remote nodes, retrieve their results, and generate cryptographic attestations creates a foundation for trustworthy distributed computing. This is especially important in decentralized systems where computation verifiability and result provenance are essential.
