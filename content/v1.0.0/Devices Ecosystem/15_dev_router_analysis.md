# Router Device Analysis (`dev_router.erl`)

## Overview

The Router Device (`dev_router.erl`) serves as the network traffic director within HyperBEAM, providing message routing capabilities for outbound messages. With 2 downstream dependents, this module handles the critical task of determining where messages should be sent and how load should be distributed across multiple potential recipients.

The device implements a sophisticated routing system based on configurable routes, each with pattern matching capabilities and load distribution strategies. It effectively functions as a load balancer and message gateway, applying rules to direct traffic to appropriate endpoints based on message content and system configuration.

By supporting multiple load balancing strategies, path transformations, and secure route management, the Router Device enables flexible network topologies while maintaining routing determinism when needed. It is particularly important for distributed deployments where messages need to be sent to specific nodes based on content, load requirements, or network topology.

## Implementation Details

### Route Configuration and Management

The module maintains routes as a priority-ordered list of maps, stored in the node's configuration:

```erlang
routes(M1, M2, Opts) ->
    Routes = hb_opts:get(routes, [], Opts),
    case hb_converge:get(<<"method">>, M2, Opts) of
        <<"POST">> ->
            Owner = hb_opts:get(operator, undefined, Opts),
            RouteOwners = hb_opts:get(route_owners, [Owner], Opts),
            {ok, Signers} = dev_message:attestors(M2),
            IsTrusted = verify_attestors_trusted(Signers, RouteOwners),
            case IsTrusted of
                true ->
                    % Add new route and sort by priority
                    NewRoutes = add_and_sort_routes(M2, Routes, Opts),
                    ok = hb_http_server:set_opts(Opts#{ routes => NewRoutes }),
                    {ok, <<"Route added.">>};
                false -> {error, not_authorized}
            end;
        _ ->
            {ok, Routes}
    end.
```

This function allows:
1. Getting the current routes via HTTP GET
2. Adding a new route via HTTP POST (if properly attested)
3. Maintaining routes in priority order for deterministic matching

### Route Matching and Selection

The module implements a multi-stage process for selecting a route:

```erlang
route(_, Msg, Opts) ->
    Routes = hb_opts:get(routes, [], Opts),
    R = match_routes(Msg, Routes, Opts),
    case (R =/= no_matches) andalso hb_converge:get(<<"node">>, R, Opts) of
        false -> {error, no_matches};
        Node when is_binary(Node) -> {ok, Node};
        Node when is_map(Node) -> apply_route(Msg, Node);
        not_found ->
            ModR = apply_routes(Msg, R, Opts),
            case hb_converge:get(<<"strategy">>, R, Opts) of
                not_found -> {ok, ModR};
                <<"All">> -> {ok, ModR};
                Strategy ->
                    ChooseN = hb_converge:get(<<"choose">>, R, 1, Opts),
                    Hashpath = hb_path:from_message(hashpath, R),
                    Nodes = hb_converge:get(<<"nodes">>, ModR, Opts),
                    Chosen = choose(ChooseN, Strategy, Hashpath, Nodes, Opts),
                    handle_chosen_nodes(Chosen, Opts)
            end
    end.
```

This process:
1. Finds a matching route based on message content
2. Handles different route types (direct node, node map, or multiple nodes)
3. Applies load distribution strategies when multiple nodes are available
4. Generates the appropriate URI for the chosen route

### Load Distribution Strategies

The module implements several strategies for distributing load across multiple nodes:

```erlang
choose(N, <<"Random">>, _, Nodes, _Opts) ->
    Node = lists:nth(rand:uniform(length(Nodes)), Nodes),
    [Node | choose(N - 1, <<"Random">>, nop, lists:delete(Node, Nodes), _Opts)];
choose(N, <<"By-Base">>, Hashpath, Nodes, Opts) when is_binary(Hashpath) ->
    choose(N, <<"By-Base">>, binary_to_bignum(Hashpath), Nodes, Opts);
choose(N, <<"By-Base">>, HashInt, Nodes, Opts) ->
    Node = lists:nth((HashInt rem length(Nodes)) + 1, Nodes),
    [Node | recursive_choose_remaining()];
choose(N, <<"Nearest">>, HashPath, Nodes, Opts) ->
    BareHashPath = hb_util:native_id(HashPath),
    NodesWithDistances = calculate_distances(Nodes, BareHashPath, Opts),
    select_nodes_by_distance(NodesWithDistances, N);
```

These strategies include:
1. **Random**: Non-deterministic, statistically even distribution
2. **By-Base**: Deterministic routing based on message hashpath (ensuring messages with the same hashpath go to the same node)
3. **Nearest**: Routing based on the "distance" between node wallet addresses and message hashpath

### Path Transformation

The module supports various path transformations for routing:

```erlang
apply_route(#{ <<"path">> := Path }, #{ <<"prefix">> := Prefix }) ->
    {ok, <<Prefix/binary, Path/binary>>};
apply_route(#{ <<"path">> := Path }, #{ <<"suffix">> := Suffix }) ->
    {ok, <<Path/binary, Suffix/binary>>};
apply_route(#{ <<"path">> := Path }, #{ <<"match">> := Match, <<"with">> := With }) ->
    % Apply the regex to the path and replace the first occurrence.
    case re:replace(Path, Match, With, [global]) of
        NewPath when is_binary(NewPath) ->
            {ok, NewPath};
        _ -> {error, invalid_replace_args}
    end.
```

These transformations allow:
1. Adding prefixes to paths
2. Adding suffixes to paths
3. Applying regex-based replacements to paths

2. **Load Distribution**: It provides mechanisms for distributing load across multiple nodes.

3. **Service Discovery**: It functions as a form of service discovery, directing messages to appropriate services.

4. **System Scalability**: It supports system scalability by facilitating distribution across multiple nodes.

5. **Message Flow Control**: It provides a control point for message flow within the system.

## Conclusion

The Router Device (`dev_router.erl`) serves as a sophisticated message routing system within HyperBEAM, enabling flexible network topologies and efficient load distribution. Its combination of template matching, path transformations, and multiple load distribution strategies provides a powerful foundation for directing network traffic according to various requirements.

The module's careful design ensures that routing can be deterministic when needed (for consistent processing of related messages) or balanced when appropriate (for even load distribution). Its integration with HyperBEAM's security model ensures that routing configuration remains protected while still allowing authorized changes.

While the current implementation is largely focused on static routing based on message content, the architecture provides a solid foundation for future enhancements like health-aware routing or dynamic strategy selection. As HyperBEAM continues to evolve, the Router Device's capabilities will likely become increasingly important for managing complex distributed deployments.
